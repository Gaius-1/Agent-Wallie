With the rapid pace of innovation in the tech industry, it can be difficult for tech professionals, programmers, and developers to keep their skills current. That being said, reading technology news and blogs every day is one of the best ways to keep up to date on the latest trends and skills needed in tech.

Finding a few good articles or blogs to read from, especially ones that are relevant to your area of expertise at your spare time, can be daunting sometimes not to talk of the time spent scrolling through a plethora of articles that don't interest you. What mostly annoys me at times, is the fact that an individual spends his/her precious time to read an article with a "click-bait" title only to realize that the contents has nothing to do with its title! 

Hmn...

So, after a long time of pain, I decided to create a bot that gets me the right news update I need at a certain time. Yes, I know there are so many options out there to give you and I the same result we need or an even more optimal result but, I just felt like solving my own problem without leveraging on the other Giants like medium, and co... üëÄ<!-- add an emoji-->

Uniquely for me, I am building a bot that recommends news update for the user based on two variables; **user's preference** and **keywords** in the article (not title because sometimes it can mislead). Then returns to user the "title", "summary of content", and its "link" through Telegram. üòå

First of all, I webscraped and cleaned data from a site, like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) to get title and link of recent news available. By reading from the link of an article, I figured out next the keywords (list of words which frequently most occurs in the content) of each article. After that, I check whether an item in the preference list given by the user corresponds to any keyword. If it does, get me the summary of that article and update the user through Telegram and Whatsapp (if the need be, using the [Twilio sandbox](https://www.twilio.com/)).

whew!
